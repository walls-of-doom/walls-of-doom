About


Walls of Doom is a minimalistic platformer by Bernardo Sulzbach.


It was originally written in ANSI C, then migrated to modern C++.

The player gets points for surviving in a space enclosed by deadly walls with
constantly moving platforms where it may get perks that might help it survive
longer and also exchange points for extra lives.
